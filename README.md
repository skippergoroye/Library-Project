### Setup
1. Use and setup the project with `yarn`.
2. Convert the project to Typescript.
3. Initialize tsconfig.
4. Create .gitignore file to ignore the node_modules

### Library Book (Rest Backend)

## Problem Description:

You will be tasked with creating a node.js based Rest application which will serve as a data source for a library web application. The application will expose one rest resources
* book Resource - This will handle CRUD endpoints for managing a book list. All endpoints will only be accessed by an authenticated user.
Using SQLite as database.

What we are testing.
Express project structure
REST API Endpoint Nomenclature
Javascript ECMA standards
Unit Testing

## Requirements:

- You can add a new book.
- You can browse through all books.
- You can view details of each book
- You can edit a book.
- You can delete a book



## How will I complete this project?
- Your application should be able to perform.
- GET Request which returns all the data in your database 
- POST Request which adds data to your database
- PUT Request which updates fields of a particular data using the id in database
- DELETE Request which removes a particular data from your database using the id
- Host your application on Heroku
-Data Format: Contains both the author's registered information and the books created by them.

]
}

```
